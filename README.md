##Overview

There is increasing interest in the effects of projected changes in global climate on the distribution of various vector-borne diseases.  Most often studies in the area concern themselves solely with the disease and take little heed of changes in vector populations.  Often this is because data on vector levels are scanty.  For tsetse flies, however, there are some excellent data on vector populations.  Moreover, there are data on how other, non-climatic, factors may effect these populations.

This group will analyse data from such a study, which examined changes in catches of the tsetse fly _G. m. morsitans_ Westwood consequent on the destruction of mammalian hosts in a semi-closed habitat.

## Background

- The experiment under consideration was carried out in Zimbabwe in the 1960s.  A 600 km2 area of tsetse habitat, populated by large numbers of game animals, was fenced and all members of six species of mammal within the area were systematically shot over a 5-year period.
- Over this period tsetse flies were sampled using an ox fly-round.
- The idea is to model the changes in apparent tsetse density as a function of the numbers of hosts remaining in the area.

## Data

The following data sources and other resources are available:

- Nagupande Mammals shot by month & species
- Nagupande Flyround catches of _G. morsitans_ by month
- Nagupande Simulation using Fisher equation
- Meteorological data from the research station (as available)
