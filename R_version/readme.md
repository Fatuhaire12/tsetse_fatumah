Double click the R project file - R studio should open and R will know where to look for the data files (in this folder) then open the nagupande_main.R file
If you run the first three lines of code a series of plots will appear.
You can see how I've made the plots by looking at the individual R scripts.
Make sure you have the necessary R packages installed otherwise you will get errors.
